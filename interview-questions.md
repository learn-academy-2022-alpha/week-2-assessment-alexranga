# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: 

A parameter is the value that is defined in a functional block and is basically used whenever we need to pass a value to a particular functional block.

The arguments are the actual values that you send your function to use when you invoke it.

Researched answer: 

A parameter is a placeholder variable that is defined inside the parentheses of the function expression. 

Arguments are parameters assigned with a value and that these values are passed to the function expression when it is invoked.


2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer:
The .map() function iterates through an array and returns a new array of the same length.

Researched answer: 

The .map method have three built-in parameters which are the value, index, and array. The value is the value "required" in the collection at that point in the iteration. The index which is optional - is the position in the collection. Lastly, the array is the entire collection that method is iterating through, which is also optional. 



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer:
  The .map() function iterates through an array and returns a new array of the same length.

  The .filter() function takes an array and filters out unwanted elements.

  Researched answer:
  When you call .map on an array, it executes that callback on every element within it, returning a new array with all of the values that the callback returned.

  Filter function is for defining a new array with elements from the initial array that match a specified condition/function.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer:
  A function is a set of instructions detailing how to do a task. When a function belongs to an object, it is called a method.
  

  Researched answer:
  Functions are reusable pieces of code that only execute when invoked and always return an output.

  Method is a function associated with a particular class and contained within an object. Objects being non-primitve data-type that store mulitple collections of data and values that consists properties.


5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer:
  When destructuring an object, you are essentially taking the properties of an object and breaking them out into individual, recallable variables.

  Researched answer:
  Object destructuring makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.


6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer:
  I was prior Navy, prior Air Force, and currently in Space Force and have encountered the word hoisting multiple times in my career. Literally, hoisting means raising something to the top. JavaScript hoisting in the other hand, I believe it should be something related to functions putting it on top, or when it is first created it should start somehwere else. before you console log it.

  Researched answer:
  Hoisting happens because JavaScript wants to find all the variables and functions before running the code to reserve memory as it compiles them. Before JavaScript code is executed, it is first compiled. 
  As it is compiled, JavaScript moves all function and variable declarations to the start of the script. This causes hoisting!


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: Once you have a class in JavaScript, you can easily create other classes that inherit from this class that both share and at the same time, have additional attributes and behavior that are unique.

2. React: is a JavaScript library that combines the speed of JavaScript and uses a new way of rendering webpages, making them highly dynamic and responsive to user input.

3. React state: in the React, “state” is an object that represents the parts of the app that can change and that each component can maintain its own state.

4. React lifecycle methods: series of events that happen from the birth (mounting), growth (update), and death (unmounting) of a React component.

5. DOM: The Document Object Model, or DOM, is the interface that allows you to programmatically access and manipulate the contents of a web page (or document).
